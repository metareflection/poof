Proposed renaming:
proposed new name, name in current paper, other possibilities, meaning
target, instance, (computation, value, fixed-point, self, result), the result (?value of the) computation that was incrementally specified
mixin, prototype, (increment, specification, spec, component, trait), the increment of computational specification
prototype, object, (mixin, trait), the conflation of mixin and target (prototype and instance) in a single entity
wrapper, prototype function, (), the composable function that takes the partial computation so far and extends it
element, class instance, (object), what is called "object" in class OO, an element of the type incrementally specified as a class (that is itself the prototype/object whose target/instance is a type)
record, record, (structure, instance, labeled product, table, object), a mapping from name/symbol to values, that typically serves as both targets and elements above, but can be considered without any OO
tagged record,,, a record with special entries (mapping for special labels?) for the metadata such as the mixin used to compute the record or the variant of a sum type or caches used by the MOP.
